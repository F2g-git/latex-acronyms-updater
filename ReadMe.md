When I write tex, I often write up my acronyms on the go without properly adding them to my acronyms definition. This script should help me out. 

This script helps me solve the issue. 
It scrapes all tex files in a given location, extracts the referenced acronyms, compares them against the acronym definitions in a provided acronyms file and adds all definitions that are missing, with a short and longform that says undefined.
